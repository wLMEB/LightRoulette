# LightRoulette
LED project at Hack(her)413 season 2024

Built using Arduino Uno, NeoPixel Ring, and a push button.

The idea of this project is to simulate a Roulette with randomized color selection.

The LED Ring will first initialize the ring with random colors, select a color in your mind, and push the button to make the lights spin, if the color you choose is lined up with the designated position, you win the game.
